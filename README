-------------------------------------
WARNING: Some checks will actually connect to target hosts and perform
actions such as attempting to upload files.  These are off by default,
use -o to enable.

About:
------
ProxMon monitors proxies for security relevant events and helps
to automate web application penetration tests.

If you run ProxMon with no options, it will attempt to run in monitor
mode on the most recently created WebScarab temporary directory.

Usage:
------
ProxMon should be run while you're testing a web application using WebScarab.
ProxMon will examine all transaction logs and report security relevant
events as they happen.

It can also be run after the fact on WebScarab save directories.

ProxMon can check for values that appear over SSL and then go cleartext.  
Values that are sent as both a cookie on the query string  and (hopefully) 
anything else that's tedious about web app pentests.
